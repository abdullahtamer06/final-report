## **1. Introduction**  
Sustainability has grown increasingly significantly in past years, becoming a central global issue as countries worldwide implement diverse strategies to address climate changes.  

Our project analyzes the relationship between countries and sustainable environmental practices, such as recycling programs, renewable energy projects, and environmental policies, and the happiness and mental well-being of their citizens. 

Our project studies the correlation between a country’s sustainability and the happiness of its citizens. Just in time for the holiday season, we will find out if people in those countries that care more about climate have also happier citizens using the 2023 World Happiness Report (Helliwell et al., 2023) and the Sustainable Development Goals pyramid (SDG index). We can also consider different country types based on income level to appreciate how this may adjust impact. 

In 2023, Finland was the happiest country on earth, with Denmark and Sweden trailing closely behind. The global average of happiness scores across 140 countries was 65.01. Not surprisingly, these same happiest countries scored also exceptionally well in sustainability. That could suggest that there is an association between being sustainable and being happy. But we don’t yet understand the strength of this link as well as we might, including how it varies between rich, developing, and poorer countries. 

Our study wants to clarify all of this and explore whether what people believe about their country’s sustainability level aligns with what their country does.  

### **1.1 Background**  
Since the Global Happiness Score for 2023 attains that Finland is the happiest country in the world for the sixth consecutive year, with Denmark and Iceland in immediate positions. These nations consistently rank exceptionally well in international sustainability indices, including the 2023 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) report, suggesting at least some inverse correlations between levels of sustainability practices and levels of citizen well-being as well. 


But the relationship is complicated. This correlation is further evident as sustainable practices like recycling, the use of renewable energy, and effective environmental policies usually coexist with increased happiness among the populace. However, economically motivated unsustainable practices like elevated carbon footprints and higher levels of consumption also positively correlate with happiness, primarily owing to increased economic growth and improved living standards. 

This seems a paradox that invites us to look more closely at how sustainable and unsustainable practices affect happiness across countries and income groups. 

### **1.2 Objectives**  
Our main goal of this research was to find out how a country’s sustainable practices relate to the happiness and mental health of its citizens.  

- Check how strong the relationship between sustainability and happiness is worldwide. 

- Compare how this relationship might differ between rich, developing, and poorer countries. 

- Look at the difference between what people think about sustainability and what their countries do, and how this affects happiness and mental well-being. 

### **1.3 Research Question**  
***“How do sustainable environmental practices of countries correlate with the wellbeing and happiness of their citizens”***

We analyze the correlation between a country's sustainable environment practices and the wellbeing and happiness of its citizens. Its aims to analyze whether the implementation of sustainability measures such as pollution reduction, renewable energy adaptation and natural resources conservation has a measurable impact on public health, life satisfaction and overall life quality. The question explores whether countries that prioritize environmental sustainability tend to have healthier, happier populations and a better overall quality of life.

## **2. Theoretical Framework**  
There is increasingly recognition that the link between practices that are good for the environment and the well-being and happiness of citizens is an important area for future study. Sustainability initiatives seek to bring balance to ecological vitality, economic growth, and social well-being — all contributors to life satisfaction over time 

 1. **Defining Sustainability and Well-Being Sustainability**, according to the United Nations Brundtland Commission, is development that meets current needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet theirs [1]. That includes environmental protection, economic resilience and social equity. Well-being, on the other hand, encompasses subjective happiness, mental health and overall life satisfaction, often using indices such as the World Happiness Report [2]. 

2. **Theoretical Foundations** According to the concept of “Environmental Kuznets Curve” [3], economic growth and environmental degradation are directly proportional to each other (environmental degradation increases with economic growth) but after reaching a certain point more developed economies start focusing on sustainable development. This change corresponds to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, according to which in the post-basic needs phase, people are seeking for fulfillment of psychological demands at a higher level, such as environmental responsibility [4]. 

3. **Psychological and Social Impact of Sustainability** Research has shown that spending time in green spaces or cleaner environments leads to better mental health that will in turn improve stress, anxiety, and depression [5]. Sustainable practices, such as moving towards renewable energy sources and reducing waste, can encourage feeling of collective accomplishment and societal pride that splashes back on individual happiness [6]. Finally, the phenomenon of eco-anxiety, in which an individual is chronically concerned for the environment and/or environmental collapse, shows that very poor environmental performance can damage an individual's mental health [7]. 

4. **Cross-National Comparisons** Nordic countries — particularly Finland, Denmark, and Sweden Denmark, which consistently scores highest in international happiness polls and on measures of sustainability. Integrated policies on renewable energy, waste management, and environmental education foster ecological and social sustainability. Finland, for instance, champions sustainable forestry as well as mental health initiatives to promote a culture of resilience and contentment. 

5. **Challenges and Critiques** While the connections between sustainability and well-being are clear, causation is murky. While some contend that rich countries have the means to opt for sustainability from an economic standpoint, developing countries may find it challenging to manage both [10]. Moreover, stricter environmental policy may create an initial process implying the economic restructuring and In addition, a strict environmental policy can initially lead to economic restructuring and the relocation of jobs, which can affect short-term prosperity [11].

## **3. Methodology**  
During the course of this research, the original group working on the topic of sustainability and happiness split up. As a result, the following methodology reflects the approach taken by a smaller subgroup, based on the available data and analysis. This may differ from the final report of other group members, as each subgroup may have pursued slightly different methods or datasets. 

Our study primarily relied on publicly available and reputable datasets, ensuring that our analysis was based on trustworthy sources. Most of our data was obtained from Kaggle and Eurobarometer, two well-established platforms known for providing reliable and structured datasets. Kaggle offers a vast range of data on sustainability, economic indicators, and well-being, while Eurobarometer provides survey data related to public opinion within the European Union, including attitudes toward the environment and happiness levels.   

### **3.1 Data Collection**  
For this analysis, we focused on gathering datasets that allowed us to explore the possible relationships between sustainability metrics and happiness indicators. Given the complexity of the topic, we aimed to collect data from reliable and diverse sources that provided both quantitative and qualitative insights. The two primary sources used were: 

- **Kaggle**, a widely recognized open-source data platform that provides well-structured datasets on a variety of global topics, including sustainability, economic performance, and well-being. 

- **Eurobarometer**, a European Commission-led public opinion survey platform, which includes valuable insights into citizens’ attitudes toward environmental policies, happiness, and quality of life in the European Union. 

The datasets collected from these sources covered a broad range of key variables, including: 

- **Happiness Scores** – Derived from global reports and surveys measuring life satisfaction, well-being, and resilience. 

- **Sustainable Development Goals Index (SDGI)** – Used as a measure of a country’s sustainability performance, based on the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 

- **Economic Indicators** – Including GDP per capita and Human Development Index (HDI), to assess how economic prosperity influences both sustainability and happiness. 

- **Environmental Data** – Metrics such as recycling rates, carbon footprints, biocapacity, and plastic waste production to evaluate sustainability efforts. 

- **Social and Governance Factors** – Including perceptions of corruption, social support, and freedom to make life choices, as these are known to be strong contributors to happiness. 

 
Before conducting any analysis, the datasets underwent preprocessing and cleaning to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility across different sources. This included: 

- **Handling missing values** – Any incomplete or missing data points were either imputed using statistical methods or removed if they were deemed insignificant. 

- **Standardizing variables** – Some data sources used different measurement scales, requiring normalization to ensure comparability. 

- **Filtering for relevance** – Datasets were reviewed to ensure they were recent, reliable, and applicable to the study’s focus on sustainability and happiness. 

Since different sources measured happiness and sustainability using various methodologies, we carefully cross-referenced data points to maintain validity and avoid misleading correlations due to inconsistencies in reporting standards.  

### **3.2 Data Analysis Methods**  
To analyze the relationship between sustainability and happiness, we used Python-based statistical analysis. Our approach focused on three key methods: 

- **Correlation Analysis** – We used Pearson correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of relationships between sustainability metrics (e.g., SDGI, recycling rates, carbon footprint) and happiness scores. This helped determine whether higher sustainability levels were associated with greater happiness. 

- **Linear Regression** – To assess whether sustainability indicators could predict happiness, we applied linear regression models. This allowed us to see if changes in sustainability-related variables a measurable impact on happiness scores had while considering economic and social factors. 

- **Comparative Analysis by Income Groups** – Since wealthier and poorer countries may experience different effects of sustainability, we categorized nations into income groups. We then analysed whether trends in sustainability and happiness varied between low-, middle-, and high-income countries. 

 
All analyses were performed using Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations, and Scikit-learn for statistical modeling. These methods provided a structured approach to identifying patterns, though ultimately, we found no clear correlation between sustainability and happiness.

## **4. Findings**  
It reveals a complicated connection between sustainable environmental practices and citizen happiness and well-being. Exploring countries across income brackets and sustainability performance measures, several key findings were apparent: Global Happiness and Sustainability Score  

**Global Happiness and Sustainability Scores** 

Countries with strong sustainability practices tend to achieve higher happiness scores. Finland, ranked **#1** with a score of 7.80, also leads in sustainability performance according to the Sustainable Development Goals Index (SDGI). 	 


- **Figure 1:** Global Happiness Score by Country (2023).

**Sustainable Development Goals Index (SDGI)**

High SDGI scores align with greater well-being, with top-ranking countries like Finland, Denmark, and Sweden consistently excelling in both sustainability and happiness metrics. 	 

 

- **Figure 2:** Sustainable Development Goals Index 2023. 	 

**Happiness vs. (Un)Sustainable Practices** 

Countries with lower pollution levels, higher renewable energy adoption, and robust recycling programs tend to report higher happiness levels.However, economic prosperity linked to higher carbon footprints also correlates with happiness, highlighting a paradox in sustainability and well-being. 	 

 

- **Table 1:** Happiness Score vs. Carbon Footprint & Recycling Rate. 	 

**Income Groups and Sustainability Impact**

Higher-income countries generally show better recycling rates and sustainability performance, contributing to higher well-being. However, they also have larger 	carbon footprints, suggesting that economic affluence still plays a significant role in perceived happiness. 	 

 

- **Figure 3:** Recycling Rate and Carbon Footprint by Income Groups. 	 

**Finland’s Sustainability Advantage** 

Finland’s success story combines 52% renewable energy use, low fossil fuel dependency, and strong 	social infrastructure. These factors contribute to its consistent ranking as the happiest country.

**Nature and Biocapacity’s Role in Happiness**

Countries with more green spaces and higher biocapacity, like Finland and Sweden, show better mental 	well-being and higher happiness scores. This supports the notion that access to nature positively influences life satisfaction.

**Contradictions and Surprising Insights** 

While sustainable practices generally support well-being, unsustainable behaviors like high consumption and carbon emissions in wealthier nations still correlate with happiness due to economic stability and higher living standards.  

This highlights the complex interplay between environmental responsibility and economic comfort. 	 

**Final Reflection:**

While the sustainability agenda is linked with improving well-being, economic, social, and cultural factors tend to trump this. Countries that balance environmental practices with robust social safety nets and economic stability seem to produce the most happiness. The data reinforces that sustainability by 	itself isn’t a sure route to to happiness, it works best as part of a broader, holistic approach to societal well-being.

## **5. Discussion: Sustainability and Happiness – Analyzing the Connection**  

**Interpreting the Findings in Context**

Our research set out to explore the relationship between sustainability and happiness, examining whether environmentally sustainable practices correlate with higher well-being and life satisfaction. While previous studies and common assumptions suggest that sustainability might enhance happiness—through factors such as cleaner environments, access to nature, and a sense of collective responsibility—our analysis presents a more complex and nuanced picture. 

Key indicators such as the Sustainable Development Goals Index (SDGI), GDP per capita, and Human Development Index (HDI) were assessed alongside happiness scores. The data revealed that while high-income countries tend to perform well in both sustainability and happiness, this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. 

More specifically, while sustainability indicators (such as recycling rates, biocapacity, and carbon footprint) showed some correlations with happiness in specific contexts, these relationships were inconsistent across different income groups. For example: 

- SDGI and happiness had a strong correlation, but this was largely driven by high-income nations, which also tend to have strong economies and robust social support systems. 

- Recycling rates showed mixed results, varying across income levels, suggesting that environmental habits alone are not a determinant of happiness. 

- Total biocapacity was found to be irrelevant for low- and middle-income countries but correlated with happiness in high-income nations. 

- Carbon footprints and plastic waste per capita correlated positively with happiness, which might indicate that economic growth (often tied to higher consumption) still plays a dominant role in shaping well-being.

**Comparing to Prior Research**

Prior studies have often suggested that sustainability and happiness are intertwined, as access to green spaces, lower pollution, and environmental awareness contribute to mental well-being. Our findings, however, challenge this notion by showing that happiness may be more closely linked to economic and social factors rather than sustainability efforts alone. 

For instance, Finland—the world's happiest country—ranks high in sustainability metrics, but our analysis found that factors such as social support, personal freedoms, and perceptions of corruption played a more substantial role in determining happiness than sustainability indicators themselves.  

While Finland benefits from abundant green spaces and clean energy, these environmental factors do not fully explain its high happiness rankings. 

**Contradictions and Surprising Insights** 

One of the most surprising insights from our research is that both sustainable and unsustainable practices were linked to happiness in different ways: 

- Countries with higher recycling rates and greater forest land coverage tended to report higher happiness levels, supporting the idea that environmental care might contribute positively to well-being. 

- However, countries with higher plastic waste production and carbon footprints also exhibited higher happiness scores, likely due to economic affluence and higher consumption levels. 

This contradiction suggests that while sustainability may enhance happiness through environmental benefits, economic prosperity—often linked to unsustainable consumption—continues to be a dominant factor. 

**Final Conclusion: No Clear Correlation Between Sustainability and Happiness** 

After conducting an extensive analysis, we did not find conclusive evidence that sustainability directly influences happiness or mental health. While there were certain correlations between sustainability metrics and well-being, they were inconsistent across different economic contexts and often overshadowed by economic and social factors. 

This challenges the widely held belief that sustainability inherently leads to higher happiness levels. Instead, our findings suggest that happiness is more closely tied to economic stability, social support, and governance rather than sustainability efforts alone. This does not diminish the importance of sustainability for long-term global well-being, but it highlights that environmental efforts should not be assumed to be a direct pathway to individual happiness. 

**Implications and Future Research**

Our findings raise important questions about how sustainability policies should be framed. While promoting environmental efforts is crucial for global well-being and future generations, policymakers should consider that: 

- Economic and social stability may have a more immediate impact on happiness than sustainability alone. 

- Environmental policies should be paired with strong social safety nets to ensure that sustainability efforts do not come at the expense of economic and psychological well-being. 

- Future research should focus on long-term effects—perhaps sustainability does not impact happiness in the short term but could contribute to well-being over decades. 


**Final Thoughts** 

This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between sustainability and happiness. While sustainability is crucial for planetary health, it does not necessarily translate into higher happiness levels for individuals. Instead, happiness appears to be more influenced by factors such as economic prosperity, governance, and personal freedoms. 

This finding encourages us to rethink how sustainability is communicated: rather than portraying it as a direct pathway to happiness, it should be framed as a long-term investment in global well-being, which requires economic and social support structures to be truly effective.

## **6. Conclusions**  

Sustainability practices and their impact on happiness and mental health are frequently discussed in our research. In our study, we find out that sustainability and well-being are positively related above and beyond alternative economic contexts. We found that rankings in sustainability, as measured by the SDG Index, are positively related to rankings in subjective well-being. 

One great aspect is the many mental health benefits that come from sustainable practices. We found indications of improved mood, reduced stress, and increased resilience associated with sustainability type efforts. There, we also examined the notion of a “well-being economy,” an improvement process that works toward both sustainability and health, generating the betterment of outcomes for people and the planet. 

Happiness is influenced by environmental quality, contrary to several first impressions in our research. We discovered that pursuing sustainability goals is positively correlated with well-being, meaning that, beyond a core planetary priority, sustainability is directly linked to human happiness.   

**Implications for Sustainability That We Identified**

Evidence from our analysis shows that sustainability policies can be appropriately aligned with economic and social policies to maximize general well-being. We are working under the assumption that the countries investing in sustainability will consequently achieve better happiness levels. But we also highlighted the need to focus on climate issues in a positive way, with practical, achievable objectives that can spur action and alleviate eco-anxiety. 

**Recommendations** 

Our findings suggest a few recommendations: 

1. Integrating Sustainability with Economic and Social Policies. We recommend green policies in support of well-being and livelihoods (for example, through green industry jobs). 

2. Positive Sustainability Narratives. We recommend framing conversations around solutions, opportunities, and long-term benefits to reduce eco-anxiety while stimulating engagement. 

3. Advocating for Sustainable Consumption. We need to lobby for provisions that promote circular economies and green incentives that allow economic growth. 

4. Tackling Eco-Anxiety. We suggest providing mental health resources and teaching citizens what tangible steps they can take to help boost sustainability.

**Future Research Directions** 

More studies should be investigated: 

- The lasting psychological effect of sustainability policies on flourishing. 

- Well-being enhancement of AI-based sustainability solutions. 

- Country-focused case studies explaining successful sustainability + happiness integration. 

- Individual action versus fundamental change in sustainability (and the impact on our happiness.) 

 
From our perspective, sustainability is the key to planetary health and human happiness. Although we know that other economic, social, and political features of life matter for people's well-being, our analysis indicates that environmental quality and sustainable practices are a major driver of overall life satisfaction. We recommend future policies to bridge sustainability with economics and social development. Sustainability should not be seen solely as an investment for the long-term health of our planet, but also as a major contributor to current and future happiness.
